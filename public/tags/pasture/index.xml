      <description>Impacts of Rainfall and Temperature Extremes On Pasture Systems
Grasses and legumes are the primary foodstock for the meat and dairy industries, with an estimated value of more than $16.5 billion in cattle, sheep, wool, dairy and meat production (Australian Bureau of Statistics). The sustainable management of grazing systems depends on the availability of high-quality forage, year-round.
A key question facing the industry is how will predicted climate scenarios affect the productivity, quality and resilience of pasture systems in coming decades.</description>
