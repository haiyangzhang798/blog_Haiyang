abstract: 'Plant carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios are powerful indicators
  of diverse ecological processes. During plant development and growth, plant C:N:P
  stoichiometry responds to environmental conditions and physiological constraints.
  However, variations caused by effects of sampling (i.e. sampling date, leaf age
  and root size) often have been neglected in previous studies. We investigated the
  relative contributions of sampling date, leaf age, root size and species identity
  to stoichiometric flexibility in a field mesocosm study and a natural grassland
  in Inner Mongolia. We found that sampling date, leaf age, root size and species
  identity all significantly affected C:N:P stoichiometry both in the pot study as
  well as in the field. Overall, C:N and C:P ratios increased significantly over time
  and with increasing leaf age and root size, while the dynamics of N:P ratios depended
  on species identity. Our results suggest that attempts to synthesize C:N:P stoichiometry
  data across studies that span regional to global scales and include many species
  need to better account for temporal variation.'
