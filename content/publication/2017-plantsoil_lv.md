abstract: The responses of functional structures in plant communities to global change
  drivers is predicted to be driven by both species turnover and intraspecific trait
  variability (ITV). However, the relative importance of those two drivers is not
  well-known, which retards our ability to predict the functional changes of plant
  community under global change scenarios. We hypothesized that ITV rather than species
  turnover would drive the nutritional responses of plant community at the initial
  stage after nitrogen and water enrichment. We measured community weighted means
  (CWM) and non-weighted means (CM) of foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratio
  in a temperate steppe after two years factorial N and water addition. Species composition
  and nutrition traits of each species were recorded in each plot. The impacts of
  N addition on community level nutrition traits were highly dependent on water conditions,
  as indicated by significant interactive effects between N and water addition. Nitrogen
  addition significantly increased CWM of foliar N, but only under ambient water condition.
  Water addition decreased CWM of foliar P and increased that of N:P. Consistent with
  our hypothesis, communities responded to both N and water addition after two years
  treatments mainly through ITV. Our results highlight the importance of ITV in driving
  short-term responses of community functional composition to the increases of nitrogen
  and water availability in the temperate steppe. The existence of interactive effects
  of N and water addition would make it more difficult to predict the impacts of N
  deposition on plant-mediated biogeochemical cycling under the scenarios of precipitation
  regime changes than previously assumed.
