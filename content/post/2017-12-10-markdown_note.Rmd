# Ten simple notes aout R markdown


 1. *italic* : put context inside two stars`**`, you got italic
 2. **bold** : put context inside four stars`****`, you had bold
 3. If you want to break the line, you just need to enter the **return twice**.
 4. superlink: `[showed_context](link)`. The link inside will guide you to the website that linked with *showed_context*.
 5. email: `<haiyang@gmail.com>`. The `<>` is used for email with links.
 6. insert internet picture `![](link)`. Further steps: define the width of the figure will be like `<img src="link", width="100">`.
 7. If want to quote, put a `>` ahead of the paragraph. One more `>`, one further step for indentation.
 8. If you want red, simple put context inside two `.
 9. If want a bullet, put a `*` ahead of the paragraph. 
 10.
