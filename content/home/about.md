# About me

Haiyang Zhang is a research fellow at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment. His research topics are plant-microbes interaction and how these interactions response and drive carbon and nutrients cycle. Specifically, he mainly focuses on how plant communicates with mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi) and nitrogen-fixing organisms, and how these plant-symbiotic associations affect plant carbon allocation (growth and storage), competition and co-existence under variable environments.

Haiyang worked at Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (Jena, Germany) and investigated the mechanisms that how plant carbohydrates control AMF-mediated N transfer. Haiyang joined HIE as a Post-Doctoral Fellow in October 2017. He is currently working on “Pastures and Climate Extreme (PACE)” project and aims to examine how the predicted climate scenarios (i.e. rainfall and temperature extremes) affect plant symbiotic associations.
